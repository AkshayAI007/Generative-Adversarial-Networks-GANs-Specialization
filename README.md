# Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GANs-Specialization
This is a GANs specialization course by DeepLearning.AI . This is an Intermediate level 3 course specialization programme where I learned to Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),Build Better Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and to Apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

# Course 1 : Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Learning Outcomes:
- Learn about GANs and their applications
- Understand the intuition behind the fundamental components of GANs
- Explore and implement multiple GAN architectures
- Build conditional GANs capable of generating examples from determined categories

The DeepLearning.AI Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization provides an exciting introduction to image generation with GANs, charting a path from foundational concepts to advanced techniques through an easy-to-understand approach. It also covers social implications, including bias in ML and the ways to detect it, privacy preservation, and more.

Build a comprehensive knowledge base and gain hands-on experience in GANs. Train your own model using PyTorch, use it to create images, and evaluate a variety of advanced GANs.

# Course 2 :Build Better Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Learning Outcome :
In this course, you will:

- Assess the challenges of evaluating GANs and compare different generative models
- Use the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) method to evaluate the fidelity and diversity of GANs
- Identify sources of bias and the ways to detect it in GANs
- Learn and implement the techniques associated with the state-of-the-art StyleGANs

# Course 3 :Apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Learning Outcome:
- Explore the applications of GANs and examine them wrt data augmentation, privacy, and anonymity
- Leverage the image-to-image translation framework and identify applications to modalities beyond images
- Implement Pix2Pix, a paired image-to-image translation GAN, to adapt satellite images into map routes (and vice versa)
- Compare paired image-to-image translation to unpaired image-to-image translation and identify how their key difference necessitates different GAN architectures
- Implement CycleGAN, an unpaired image-to-image translation model, to adapt horses to zebras (and vice versa) with two GANs in one
